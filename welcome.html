          <p>The Chippewa Valley IT Internship Hub is designed to give you the best chance of finding open intership postings. Lower level postings are not always heavily promoted through online job boards. Often, the only place you'll find them is buried deep in company's website. We aim to simplify that process by doing the tedious site navigation for you! Please note that not all websites allow for extensively refined job searchs, or even have a jobs page at all. In these cases, we've brought you as far as we can, but we still think you'll be better off for it.</p>

          <p>Let us know what you think of this resource. We'd like to hear constructive criticism, compliments, or stories of finding employment! More importantly, if you know of a company that offers IT interships in the Chippewa Valley not listed on our site, <a href="mailto:cvitinternshiphub@gmail.com">please let us know!</a> But most importantly, we wish you luck as you take your first steps into the exciting and rewarding field of information technology!</p>
