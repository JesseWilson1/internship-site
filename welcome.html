        <p>This site is designed to help future IT professionals of the Chippewa Valley take their first step into the professional world.</p>
        <p>Searching for an internship through a job board, word of mouth, or career fair is a great way to get started. However, some companies may not promote their positions as well as others. However, posting positions can be an expensive endeavor for a company and may not see the value in spending money on an internship position. This lack of promotion can lead to missed opportunities for new developers. Your dream internship may be out there, but the only place it's listed is deep within the company's website.</p>
        <p>The goal of the Chippewa Valley IT Intership Hub is to connect you to open positions posted within a company's website. Instead of visiting a company's homepage and clicking through a complicated site map and filtering out irrelevant postings on their job board to find local internship postings, simply click on a company logo and you'll be brought as close to the IT intership postings that the site will allow. We've done the tedious site navigation for you! Please note that not all websites allow for extensively refined job searchs, or even have a jobs page at all. In these cases, we've brought you as far as we can, but we still think you'll be better off for it!</p>

Most importantly, if you know of a company that offers IT interships in the Chippewa Valley not listed on our site, please let us know! We would love to add them to our list. This site has been created to serve YOU! Help us do that by sending us an <a href="mailto:jrupslauskas@gmail.com">Email</a>. But most importantly, we wish you the very best of luck as you take your first steps into the exciting and rewarding field of information technology!</p>
