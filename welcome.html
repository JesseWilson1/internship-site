        <p>Future IT professionals of the Chippewa Valley, get ready to start your career.</p>
        <p>The Chippewa Valley IT Internship Hub is designed to give you the best chance of finding open intership postings. Lower level postings are not always heavily promoted through online job boards. Instead, they're only posted on a company's website. Navigating through all these sites can be tedious and extensive however. Instead of clicking through several complicated site maps and filtering out irrelevant postings, simply click a company logo and you'll be brought as close to the IT intership postings that the site will allow. We've done the tedious site navigation for you! Please note that not all websites allow for extensively refined job searchs, or even have a jobs page at all. In these cases, we've brought you as far as we can, but we still think you'll be better off for it.</p>

More importantly, if you know of a company that offers IT interships in the Chippewa Valley not listed on our site, <a href="mailto:jrupslauskas@gmail.com">please let us know!</a> But most importantly, we wish you the very best of luck as you take your first steps into the exciting and rewarding field of information technology!</p>
